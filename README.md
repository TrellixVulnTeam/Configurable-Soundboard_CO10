# Configurable-Soundboard - Nmeade is a Soundboard!

An app I started making after Nmeade got called a soundboard due to his memorable expressions.

I'm hoping to make this into an app that anyone can configure to their will through simple txt editing.

# Progress:

It's a pretty new app so a lot of the configuration information isn't implemented yet.

# FAQ:

Is this published on the PlayStore?

Not at the moment.

Can I get this app?

Yep! There's a stable release below for Android!

https://github.com/Whatnoww/Configurable-Soundboard/releases/tag/1

Grab the apk and install!

Will this come out for iOS?

I can't test iOS devices so unless someone is willing to help me out here it won't be posible.
