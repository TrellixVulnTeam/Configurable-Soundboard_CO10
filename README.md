# Configurable-Soundboard - Nmeade is a Soundboard!

[Video](https://youtu.be/Te0RG1UHByc)

A pretty basic app I started making in Kivy after [Nmeade](https://www.youtube.com/Nmeade) got called a soundboard due to his memorable expressions.

I'm hoping to make this into an app that anyone can configure to their will through simple txt editing, including being able to edit colors, sounds, pictures and the number of categories with ease.

# Progress:

It's a pretty new app so a lot of the configuration information isn't implemented yet, at this point I'm only trying to improve stability and performance.

# FAQ:

### Is this published on the PlayStore?

Not at the moment. If enough people want it there I'll try to get it up. It's a 25$ fee for a dev account.

### Can I get this app?

Not yet! Still waiting for permission to release it!

### Will this come out for iOS?

I can't test iOS devices so unless someone is willing to help me out here it won't be posible.

### I want to request features or sound effects. Can I do that?

Yes! It's just a matter of whether I'll have time to do it or not. I'm more likely to accept sound effect requests based on videos, since I usually try to update the app with a video per day. You can send me requests by emailing me at:
whatnoww2@gmail.com
or tweeting at me: https://twitter.com/WhatnowwYT

### How can I get notified for future updates?

I'll be posting updates and changelogs both here and on my [Channel](https://www.youtube.com/whatnoww2) as videos.
