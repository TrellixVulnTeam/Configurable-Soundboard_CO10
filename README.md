# Configurable-Soundboard - Nmeade is a Soundboard!

A pretty basic app I started making in Kivy after Nmeade got called a soundboard due to his memorable expressions.

I'm hoping to make this into an app that anyone can configure to their will through simple txt editing, including being able to edit colors, sounds, pictures and the number of categories with ease.

# Progress:

It's a pretty new app so a lot of the configuration information isn't implemented yet, at this point I'm only trying to improve stability and performance.

# FAQ:

Is this published on the PlayStore?

Not at the moment. If enough people want it there I'll try to get it up. It's a 25$ fee for a dev account.

Can I get this app?

Yep! There's a stable release below for Android!

https://github.com/Whatnoww/Configurable-Soundboard/releases/tag/1

Grab the apk and install!

Will this come out for iOS?

I can't test iOS devices so unless someone is willing to help me out here it won't be posible.
